# Machine Learning Session Recap - Iris Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the outcomes of a machine learning session focused on the initial steps of analyzing and preparing a small, manually created portion of the Iris dataset.

## Session Summary

The session covered the following key stages:

1.  **Manual Dataset Creation:** A small part of the Iris dataset was manually entered and saved as a `.csv` file (`iris_manual.csv`) to simulate real-world data acquisition.

2.  **Missing Value Handling:** A missing value in the 'petal length (cm)' column was identified and filled using the mean of that column. This ensures data completeness for further analysis.

3.  **Data Normalization:** The features were scaled using `StandardScaler` to bring them onto a similar range. This preprocessing step is important for many machine learning algorithms.

4.  **Data Splitting:** The data was divided into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) using `train_test_split`. This allows for training a model on one part of the data and evaluating its performance on unseen data. The split resulted in 8 samples for training and 2 samples for testing.

5.  **Understanding the Split:** The training data (`X_train`, `y_train`) is used to teach the model, while the testing data (`X_test`, `y_test`) is used to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen information.

## Repository Files

-   `iris_manual.csv`: The manually created subset of the Iris dataset.
-   `README.md`: This file summarizing the session.

## Key Learnings

This session demonstrated the fundamental steps of:

-   Creating a dataset.
-   Handling missing data.
-   Preprocessing data through normalization.
-   Splitting data for training and evaluation.
-   Understanding the purpose of training and testing datasets.

## Next Steps

next steps include exploring different machine learning models, training them on the prepared data, and evaluating their performance using the testing set.
